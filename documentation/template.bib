abstract = {With the development of magnetic resonance imaging techniques for acquiring diffusion tensor data frombiological tissue, visualiza- tion of tensor data has become a new research focus. The diffusion tensor describes the directional dependence of water molecules’ diffusion and can be represented by a three-by-three symmetric matrix. Visualization of second-order tensor fields is difficult be- cause the data values have many degrees of freedom. Existing vi- sualization techniques are best at portraying the tensor’s proper- ties over a two-dimensional field, or over a small subset of loca- tions within a three-dimensional field. A means of visualizing the global structure in measured diffusion tensor data is needed. We propose the use of direct volume rendering, with novel approaches for the tensors’ coloring, lighting, and opacity assignment. Hue- balls use a two-dimensional colormap on the unit sphere to illus- trate the tensor’s action as a linear operator. Lit-tensors provide a lighting model for tensors which includes as special cases both lit-lines (from streamline vector visualization) and standard Phong surface lighting. Together with an opacity assignment based on a novel two-dimensional barycentric space of anisotropy, thesemeth- ods are shown to produce informative renderings of measured dif- fusion tensor data from the human brain.},
