abstract = {Abstract Gmsh is an open-source 3-D finite element grid generator with a build-in CAD engine and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced visualization capabilities. This paper presents the overall philosophy, the main design choices and some of the original algorithms implemented in Gmsh. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.}
